#1. If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?

```{r}
q1 <- rolldie(1) 
q1
```
# 4 rows so i know that out of the 6 options 4 of them satisfy being less than 5
```{r}
q1 %>%
  filter(X1 < 5)
#then the maths is..

4/6
```

#2. How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?

```{r}
q2 <- rolldie(3) 
q2
nrow(q2)
#or expressed another way 6*6*6
6*6*6
```

#3. In an experiment where we roll four dice:

A)how many outcomes are in the event total_equals_5_6_7 (i.e. the total of the four dice equals 5, 6 or 7)?
# 8 as per below
B)what is the probability of this event?
#8/1296 = [1] 0.00617284
C)what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii?
#
```{r}
roll_four <- rolldie(4) %>%
  mutate(total = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4) %>%
  filter(total == c(4:7))
roll_four

```

```{r}
8/1296


```
#4. Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?
```{r}
chairs <- as_tibble(
  permutations(n = 5,
               r = 5,
               repeats.allowed = FALSE))
chairs

#so there's 120 different height orders for them to sit, so probability is..

1/120
[1] 0.008333333
```
#5. I roll six dice:

what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?

what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?

```{r}
#what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?

roll_six <- rolldie(6)
  roll_six
  
  #46,656 different ways to roll 6 dice so probability is...
  6/46656
  
```
what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?
#There's 720 differnet ways to satisfy one of each number in any order out of the poss 46656 see below for working 
```{r}

```
#6. If I draw a single card from a 52-card deck, and it is black, what is the probability that its suit is spades?
```{r}
#it's .5. 

#half of the black cards in a deck are spades. 


```

7. Eight patients: Alice, Bob, Carmen, Dinesh, Ella, Fergus, Gianna and Henry are waiting to see a doctor, but only five appointment slots are left today.

In how many different orders can the doctor see patients today?
6720

```{r}
patients <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Carmen", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna","Henry")

patients_comb <- as_tibble( permutations(n = 8, r = 5, v = patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE))
patients_comb
nrow(patients_comb)
```

What is the probability of Gianna and Danesh both being seen today? 4200/6720 = 0.625
```{r}
gianna_danesh <- patients_comb %>%
  isin("Gianna", "Danesh", ordered = TRUE)
gianna_danesh
occurences <- table(unlist(gianna_danesh))

gianna_danesh
```

(harder) Carmen and Henry have now been triaged as high priority and will be seen in the first two available slots, although their order hasnâ€™t yet been determined. In how many different orders can the patients now be seen?
```{r}
patients_new <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna")

patients_triage <- as_tibble( permutations(n = 6, r = 4, v = patients_new, repeats.allowed = FALSE))
patients_triage
nrow(patients_triage)
```

```{r}

```
