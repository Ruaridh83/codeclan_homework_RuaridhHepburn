col_names =

```{r}
cars <- read_csv("data/cars.csv")
```

```{r}
cars

```
Read in the cars.csv file and use the col_types() function to ensure you load in:

X1 as character
mpg, cyl, disp, hp as double
vs as logical

so only need to change vs
```{r}
car_data <- read_csv("data/cars.csv", col_types = cols( X1 = col_character(), 
                      vs = col_logical()))
```

```{r}
car_data
```
Read in the scotland.txt file using the appropriate function.

```
```{r}
scotland <- read_csv("data/scotland.txt")
scotland
