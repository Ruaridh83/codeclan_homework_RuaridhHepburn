```
Label the data points with their row number in the data frame using geom_text() [Hint - you can pass aes(label = 1:nrow(project)) to this layer to generate row index labels]


Identify by eye any points you think might be outliers and note their labels. 5

Further split your outliers into those you think are ‘influential’ or ‘non-influential’ based on a visual assessment of their leverage.

```{r}
project <- project_management
```

```{r}
project %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = actual_length, y = estimated_length) +
  geom_text(label = 1:nrow(project)) +
  
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
lm(formula = project$actual_length ~ project$estimated_length)
```

```{r}
